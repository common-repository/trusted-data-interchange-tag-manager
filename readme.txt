Download the Internet's most powerful free tag management system, now used by more than 1,000 sites, and manage your site's JavaScript data collection tags through a simple web interface without editing templates.

== Description ==

The [Mezzobit](http://www.mezzobit.com/) tag management system (TMS) plug-in permits our tag management system to manage third-party JavaScript data collection tags on your WordPress site. Once you install the plug-in, you can remove all third-party data collection tags and pixels -- analytics, social widgets, conversion analysis, etc. --  from your website, and insert a single Mezzobit tag. More than 1,000 sites run our TMS, including Fast Company, The Daily Meal, Tampa Bay Times, and The New York Review of Books.

Using our simple web portal, you can then place tags on your pages and configure them to fire based on your rules without writing a single line of code. Mezzobit also provides complimentary phone consulting to guide customers through implementation. Our tools also can manage your user-facing privacy policies and notices.

* **Faster site performance**
Third-party tags are prevented from interfering with the rest of the page loading. This allows users to interact with content sooner, increasing conversion and decreasing abandonment. Only tags appropriate for a given page and user are run, further accelerating pages. Our customers have seen 30%+ improvement in over page load time.

* **Launch campaigns faster**
Deploying new tags for marketing campaigns can be done in minutes, not weeks or months. And changes can be made on the fly, permitting greater marketing agility and faster time to market.

* **Less technical support**
Once our tag is embedded in your webpage, you never need to touch it again. WordPress users can install our plug-in for even speedier deployment. Implementation, maintenance and testing can done with minimal developer involvement.

We also have [viewability optimization, ad blocking detection, and data control tools](http://www.mezzobit.com/products/) that can be easily added to further enhance revenue. For more information, please visit our [website](http://www.mezzobit.com/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does this cost? =

Using our TMS is free for all users and will continue to be so in the future. We will offer enhanced data interchange platforms for more advanced customers who require additional functionality.

= What's involved in setting up my site to use a tag management system =

Once you've installed the TMS plug-in and created an account, there are really three steps to going live.

1. **Create tags in the TMS:** Whenever you implement a tag, your vendor will provide a snippet of JavaScript that you insert into a page or template. Just paste this into the TMS and save it. Alternately, we have a growing library of partner tags where you can select the tag, provide your account information, and the tag will automatically be configured for you without having to touch the actual tag code.

2. **Create a container in the TMS and associate tags:** A container acts as an air traffic controller for tags. It determines which tags should be included on your site. Creating the most basic of containers involves naming the container, specifying the domain it will be serving, picking the tags you want to be served and activating the container.

3. **Connecting a container with your WordPress account:** The plug-in asks you to log into your TMS account, and then displays a list of containers. Just choose the appropriate container and if the container has been activated for production, you're live.

From this point, all administration of your tags and containers occurs within the TMS environment, which automatically updates your WordPress site in the background. If you want to deploy a new tag, just add it to the TMS, associate it with a container and it goes live within having to do anything in WordPress.

You can certainly get more sophisticated about this. The TMS lets users create rules to govern when tags fire, which helps better target tags and improve user experience.

Mezzobit offer free phone consultation to walk users through deployment, and for select customers, will provide hands-on implementation. [Contact us](http://www.mezzobit.com/contact-us/) to learn more.

= Should I manage tags within the TMS that have their own WordPress plug-ins? =

It's up to you. There are advantages in having all your tags managed in one location and there are typically performance advantages in using our TMS. But for certain tag providers, their plug-ins provide additional functionality that may be useful to have in the WordPress administrative console.
